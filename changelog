  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):

      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]

      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.

      above webmin note &/or #1904.

  * Backup (tklbam):
    - Ported dependencies to Debian Bookworm; otherwise unchanged.

      backports. Also support non-free backports.

    - Adminer (only on LAMP based apps) listen on IPv6.
    - Nginx/NodeJS (NodeJS based apps only) listen on IPv6.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:
    - Remove rsyslog package (systemd journal now all that's needed).
    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
    - Improve turnkey-artisan so that it works reliably in cron jobs (only
      Laravel based LAMP apps).
